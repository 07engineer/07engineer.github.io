## Introduction  
At different times of day, I benefit from listening to recordings on mindfulness such as those found in the app "Insight Timer". However, they are not custom for me. Below are manuscript drafts which I read into my phone as a voice memo and I replay them at the specified times. I decided to version control them so I can update them as my priorities change. 

## After Waking


## Morning Commute

## Work Break

## Stressed 

## Lunch

## Evening Commute

## Before sleep
